VR Train Scheduling Application for Android
Project Description
This project is centered around developing an Android application that provides users with real-time information on train schedules using the open interfaces of VR (Finnish Railways). The application leverages REST services to fetch schedule information from VR's open pages and presents it to users in a clear and user-friendly format.

Technologies Used
Backend: REST services through VR's open interface
Frontend: Android
Language: Java
Features
Real-time train schedule information by stations
Tracking of train movements
Schedule search and display in a user-friendly interface

Learning Experiences and Achievements
During this project, I gained valuable experience in utilizing and integrating REST services into an Android application. I also improved my skills in working with databases and interfaces. I learned a lot about the fundamentals of programming, best practices in web development, and mobile application development.
